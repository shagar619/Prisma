# Prisma ORM

Prisma is an open-source database toolkit that simplifies database access and management for developers. It provides a type-safe and intuitive way to interact with databases, making it easier to build and maintain applications. Prisma consists of three main components: Prisma Client, Prisma Migrate, and Prisma Studio.

> ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages and relational databases.

**Prisma Client**
Prisma Client is an auto-generated query builder that allows developers to interact with their databases using a type-safe API. It supports various databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB. Prisma Client provides a simple and efficient way to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database records.

**Prisma Migrate**
Prisma Migrate is a database migration tool that helps developers manage schema changes in their databases. It allows developers to define their database schema using a declarative syntax and automatically generates migration scripts to apply those changes to the database. Prisma Migrate ensures that database schema changes are versioned and can be easily rolled back if needed.

**Prisma Studio**
Prisma Studio is a web-based GUI that allows developers to explore and manipulate their database data visually. It provides an intuitive interface for viewing, editing, and deleting records in the database. Prisma Studio makes it easy for developers to inspect their data and perform operations without writing SQL queries.

Overall, Prisma ORM simplifies database access and management for developers by providing a type-safe and intuitive way to interact with databases. It streamlines the development process and helps developers build robust and scalable applications.
